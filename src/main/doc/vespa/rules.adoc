== Efficient Full Text Search With Vespa: Adding Search Rules
image:../static/image/calendar.png[cal,20] [.greyed]#8 Mar 2024#

Vespa rules are used for replacing or filtering out insignificant search terms that does not bring any value to search results.
A common scenario involves disregarding common words like "the" during searches.

=== Goal
Implement link:https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-rewriting.html#rules[rules] that disregard specific words in search requests.

=== Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure  link:/vespa/ranking[Customizing Ranking] is completed.

=== Performing a Search without Rules:
When sending a request with the search term "the diamond," several documents containing only the word "the" are retrieved:
----
curl http://localhost:8080/search/ \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"queryProfile": "book_v1",
"search_term": "the diamond",
}'
----
Letâ€™s modify our application to ignore such terms.

=== Adding Rule to the VAP:
Add link:https://github.com/anton-kolhun/vespa-sample/blob/enable-search-rules/book/rules/stopwords.sr[./rules/stopwords.sr] file into the VAP.


----
@default

# Stopwords: replace them by nothing
title:[stopword] -> ;
description:[stopword] -> ;
tags:[stopword] -> ;
ngram:[stopword] -> ;
[stopword] :- a,am,an,and,are,as,at,be,because,been,but,by,can,com,could,did,do,does,for,from,had,has,have,he,her,him,his,how,i,if,in,is,it,its,me,my,no,not,of,on,or,our,she,should,so,some,someone,than,that,the,their,them,then,there,these,they,this,through,to,too,us,was,way,we,were,what,when,where,which,who,why,will,with,would,www,you,your,can t,doesn t,how s,it s,that s,there s,what s,when s;

----
Here, we specify:

- the set of words to be ignored (`[stopword]`)
- fields to which the provided rule should be applied (`title`, `description`, `tags`, `ngram`)

=== Enabling the Rule in the Query Profile
Activate the rule in link:https://github.com/anton-kolhun/vespa-sample/blob/enable-search-rules/book/search/query-profiles/book_v1.xml#L20[book_v1] as follows:
----
<query-profile id="book_v1">
     ...
  <field name="rules.off">false</field>
     ...
</query-profile>
----

Now, when resubmitting the same request
the response contains only the document "The Diamond as Big as the Ritz."

=== Summary

By following these steps, we have successfully implemented and activated the rule to filter out insignificant words in search requests.
