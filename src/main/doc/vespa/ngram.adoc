== Efficient Full Text Search With Vespa: N-Gram Search
image:../static/image/calendar.png[cal,20] [.greyed]#8 Mar 2024#

N-gram search offers an effective solution for handling spelling corrections by breaking down words into smaller units (n-grams).
This simplifies the process of identifying misspellings based on the similarity of the n-grams.

=== Goal
Explore the built-in link:https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#gram[N-gram] capabilities of Vespa.

=== Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure  link:/vespa/ranking[Customizing Ranking] is completed

=== Performing a Search with a Typo:
When submitting a request with the search term "diamont" (a typo for "diamond"),
the expected document titled "The Diamond as Big as the Ritz" is not retrieved.
----
curl http://localhost:8080/search/ \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"queryProfile": "book_v1",
"search_term": "diamont",
}'
----
Let's adjust our VAP to handle such scenarios.

=== Adding an N-Gram Field to the Schema:
To use N-Gram functionality, modify the link:https://github.com/anton-kolhun/vespa-sample/blob/add-ngram/book/schemas/book.sd#L33-L48[book] schema as outlined below:


----
search book {
    document book {
      ...
    }

    field ngram type string {
        indexing {
            # Initialize variables
            "" | set_var tags_var | set_var description_var | set_var title_var;

            select_input {tags: (input tags | join " ") | set_var tags_var;};
            select_input {description: input description | set_var description_var;};
            select_input {title: input title | set_var title_var;};

            get_var tags_var . " " . (get_var description_var) . " " . (get_var title_var)  | index
        }
        match {
            gram
            gram-size: 2
        }
    }
    ...

    rank-profile custom inherits default {

        rank-properties {
            ...
            query(ngram_match_weight): 0.2
            query(text_match_weight) : 0.8

        }
        ...

        function ngramMatchScore () {
           expression: fieldMatch(ngram)
         }

        first-phase {
            expression: textMatchScore * query(ngram_match_weight)  + ngramMatchScore * query(ngram_match_weight)
            rank-score-drop-limit: 0.01
        }

    }
}
----
In this example the `gram-size` is set to 2, but any value can be used.
A lower gram-size will get more hits, but may also find more irrelevant hits.
There have also been weights assigned for text and n-gram scores (`query(ngram_match_weight)`, `query(ngram_match_weight)`).
To avoid false positive results caused by N-Gram match - try to use a relatively small weight for ngram

=== Adding a N-Gram field To The Query Profile
Update the link:https://github.com/anton-kolhun/vespa-sample/blob/add-ngram/book/search/query-profiles/book_v1.xml#L14[book_v1] query profile as follows:
----
<query-profile id="book_v1">
     ...
    <field name="yql">select * from book where
      (
        ([{"defaultIndex": "title","grammar": "any","stem": true,"allowEmpty": true, "usePositionData": true}]userInput(@search_term)) OR
        ([{"defaultIndex": "description","grammar": "any","stem": true,"allowEmpty": true, "usePositionData": true}]userInput(@search_term)) OR
        ([{"defaultIndex": "tags","grammar": "any","stem": true,"allowEmpty": true, "usePositionData": true}]userInput(@search_term)) OR
        ([{"defaultIndex": "ngram","grammar": "any","stem": true,"allowEmpty": true, "usePositionData": true}]userInput(@search_term))
      )
    %{query_filter}
    </field>
     ...
</query-profile>
----

Now, when resubmitting the same request with the search term "diamont,"
the response includes the document with the title "The Diamond as Big as the Ritz."

=== Summary

By following these steps, we have successfully implemented N-gram search functionality,
enabling the retrieval of results for search terms that may contain typos
